# ADR-001: Core Architecture Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to build a comprehensive observability platform for AWS workloads that is:
- Scalable and cost-effective
- Secure by default
- Easy to deploy and maintain
- Extensible for future requirements

## Decision

### 1. AWS CDK for Infrastructure as Code
**Decision**: Use AWS CDK with Python for all infrastructure provisioning.

**Rationale**:
- Type safety and IDE support
- Reusable constructs and patterns
- Native AWS service integration
- Familiar Python syntax for the team

### 2. EventBridge as Central Event Bus
**Decision**: Use EventBridge custom bus for all platform events and integrations.

**Rationale**:
- Decoupled architecture
- Easy integration with external systems
- Built-in retry and DLQ capabilities
- Schema registry support

### 3. Multi-Severity Alerting Strategy
**Decision**: Implement four severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) with separate SNS topics.

**Rationale**:
- Flexible notification routing
- Prevents alert fatigue
- Supports different escalation policies
- Easy to extend with new channels

### 4. Step Functions for Remediation
**Decision**: Use Step Functions for complex remediation workflows.

**Rationale**:
- Visual workflow representation
- Built-in error handling and retries
- Integration with AWS services
- Audit trail for compliance

### 5. KMS Encryption by Default
**Decision**: Encrypt all observability data using customer-managed KMS keys.

**Rationale**:
- Security best practices
- Compliance requirements
- Key rotation capabilities
- Audit trail for key usage

## Consequences

### Positive
- Scalable and maintainable architecture
- Strong security posture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to extend and modify

### Negative
- Additional complexity compared to simpler solutions
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with CDK
- Potential cost implications of managed services

## Alternatives Considered

### Terraform vs CDK
- **Rejected**: Terraform lacks type safety and native AWS integration
- **Chosen**: CDK provides better developer experience and AWS service coverage

### CloudWatch Events vs EventBridge
- **Rejected**: CloudWatch Events is legacy service
- **Chosen**: EventBridge offers more features and better integration capabilities

### Lambda vs Step Functions for Workflows
- **Rejected**: Lambda alone lacks visual representation and complex workflow capabilities
- **Chosen**: Step Functions provide better workflow management and error handling
